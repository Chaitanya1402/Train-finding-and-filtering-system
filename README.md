# Train-finding-and-filtering-system
There are around 12 thousand trains running in India daily. It's difficult to search for a particular train or trains running between two particular stations.
It's also tedious to filter among the trains, like if we want to display only the trains running in the morning, it consumes a lot of time.
This project resolves the issue of finding and filtering through source and destination stations and displays trains based on the required time of the day.
This will give the user a clear idea of the trainâ€™s whole journey between its source and destination.

Functionality:

The user will be able to enter his source and destination railway stations.

The server will display all the trains along with the required details like departure and arrival time.

Users can also apply various filters, like morning trains, etc.
